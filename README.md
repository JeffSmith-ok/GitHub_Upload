# First Challenge Project at Columbia Engineering Fintech Program: Valuing Microcredit Loans for a Lending Startup

In this project, firstly, I will automate simple calculations for the loan portfolio summaries, such as summing the loans, finding the total number of loans and calculate the average loan price. Secondly, I will analyze the loans, by extracting the future value through a present value function, using an annual discount rate of 20%. Thirdly, I will create a list of inexpensive loans and append the loans that are less than or equal to $500.00 to the inexpesive loan list, and print the list. Finally, I will save the inexpensive loan list in a csv file that I will create using a csvwriter.
